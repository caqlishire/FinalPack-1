#Here are what I learned from each week:
### Week 1
- First week, we introduced ourselves and shared some background about Linux to each other. Instructor informed us about his class, textbook, syllabus, assignments, D2L Brightspace, grade, devices and software  required for class such as a laptop, USB drive, and virtual machines. I read chapter 1 and learned about kernel which is managing tasks for processes, memory, device drivers and system calls and support. I also learned about user space which Linux system is runnning.
### Week 2
- What I learned from chapter2 was amazing. Learning these simple and everyday commands, I find it really helpful. Here is my [week 2 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Week3/blob/master/Week2.sh). I also created a github acccount, posted in D2L and sent the username to the instructor.
