#Here are what I learned from each week:
### Week 1
- First week, we introduced ourselves and shared some background about Linux to each other. Instructor informed us about his class, textbook, syllabus, assignments, D2L Brightspace, grade, devices and software  required for class such as a laptop, USB drive, and virtual machines. I read chapter 1 and learned about kernel which is managing tasks for processes, memory, device drivers and system calls and support. I also learned about user space which Linux system is running.
### Week 2
- What I learned from chapter2 was amazing. Learning these simple and everyday commands, I find it really helpful. Here is my [week 2 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Week3/blob/master/Week2.sh). I also created a github account, posted in D2L and sent the username to the instructor.  
### Week 3
- I created my [first repository](https://github.com/vangx033/hello-world) in Github. I learned the three commands to get my github update; git add *, git commit and git push. I read chapter 3 and applied on my [week 3 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Chapter3Script). I learned how to change directory and send text to a black hole. 
### Week 4
- I learned how to download a Linux ISO image (I downloaded Ubuntu) and saved it in my USB drive. Then make the Ubuntu OS bootable from the USB drive. I learned a big lession from this week, I accidently installed the Ubuntu OS and overridden my Windows OS. I had to re-format my machine back to Windows OS. I read chapter 5 and applied to my [week 4 script](https://github.com/vangx033/ch4script).  
### Week 5
- Chapter 5 is more about GRUB. Here is my [week 5 script](https://github.com/vangx033/week5). I utilized the dmesg command to view kernel's boot and logs. I also used cat /proc/cdmline command to view ketnel's parameters.
### Week 6
- No class (V-day). I re-installed Windows OS back to my machine. Here is my [week 6 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Week6).
### Week 7
- I wrote a [500 words essay](https://github.com/vangx033/week7) respond to [Bill Langenberg's](https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/notes/blangenberg.pdf). I also read chapter 7 and applied on my [week 7 script](https://github.com/vangx033/week7/blob/master/Ch7script.md).
