#Here are what I learned from each week:
### Week 1
- First week, we introduced ourselves and shared some background about Linux to each other. Instructor informed us about his class, textbook, syllabus, assignments, D2L Brightspace, grade, devices and software  required for class such as a laptop, USB drive, and virtual machines. I read chapter 1 and learned about kernel which is managing tasks for processes, memory, device drivers and system calls and support. I also learned about user space which Linux system is running.
### Week 2
- What I learned from chapter2 was amazing. Learning these simple and everyday commands, I find it really helpful. Here is my [week 2 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Week3/blob/master/Week2.sh). I also created a github account, posted in D2L and sent the username to the instructor.  
### Week 3
- I created my [first repository](https://github.com/vangx033/hello-world) in Github. I learned the three commands to get my github update; git add *, git commit and git push. I read chapter 3 and applied on my [week 3 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Chapter3Script). I learned how to change directory and send text to a black hole. 
### Week 4
- I learned how to download a Linux ISO image (I downloaded Ubuntu) and saved it in my USB drive. Then make the Ubuntu OS bootable from the USB drive. I learned a big lesson from this week, I accidently installed the Ubuntu OS and overridden my Windows OS. I had to re-format my machine back to Windows OS. I read chapter 5 and applied to my [week 4 script](https://github.com/vangx033/ch4script).  
### Week 5
- Chapter 5 is more about GRUB. Here is my [week 5 script](https://github.com/vangx033/week5). I utilized the dmesg command to view kernel's boot and logs. I also used cat /proc/cdmline command to view kernel's parameters.
### Week 6
- No class (V-day). I re-installed Windows OS back to my machine. Here is my [week 6 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Week6).
### Week 7
- I wrote a [500 words essay](https://github.com/vangx033/week7) respond to [Bill Langenberg's eassay](https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/notes/blangenberg.pdf). I also read chapter 7 and applied on my [week 7 script](https://github.com/vangx033/week7/blob/master/Ch7script.sh). One of the command I use was "logger" command to testing the system logger.   
### Week 8
- Week 8 was to re-write and re-apply all the commands that I've learned so far. I simply utilized commands from chapter 2 to chapter 7 for my [midterm script](https://github.com/vangx033/week8/blob/master/Week8Script.sh). I presented my midterm script to the class.  
### Week 9
- I was amazed by how great and nicely written scripts from all my peers. I never thought there is such a command as "sleep". I have used it a lot for my later scripts.
### Week 10
- Spring Break
### Week 11
- I like chapter 9 and 10 since I'm going for computer network engineering. I learned about network basic such as LAN, WAN and its gateway. I learned about the 4 network layers. I also learned about TCP, UDP, and DHCP. Here are my [chapter 9 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Chapter9/blob/master/Ch9script.sh) and [chapter 10 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Chapter10/blob/master/Ch10script.sh). 
### Week 12
- I read about [How does the Internet Work](http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/internet.html) and downloaded wireshark. I also went throught [tcpdump tutorial](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tcpdump/) and wrote a [tcpdump script](https://github.com/vangx033/Chapter11/blob/master/tcpdumpscript.sh). I learned that tcpdump is used to capture the traffics passing through your network. I also read chapter 11 and here is my [chapter 11 script](https://github.com/vangx033/Chapter11/blob/master/Ch11script.sh). I learned how to differentiate using quotes. 
We got divided into 5 groups for our final projects. Our group decided to set up a gaming server(minecraft) and named our group as [Code-Blockers](https://github.com/grenack/Code-Blockers). 
### Week 13
- I missed this week. I went to a funeral in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
### Week 14
- As for week 14, chapter 14 was about Window Managers and chapter 15 was about the C compiler. I learned some commands such as "xwininfo" to see the location of the icon and "xlsclients -l" to list all the window IDs forand clients. Here are my two essays for [chapter 14 - A Brief Survey of the Linux Desktop](https://github.com/vangx033/Week14/blob/master/Ch14.md) and [chapter 15 - Devevopment Tools](https://github.com/vangx033/Week14/blob/master/Ch15.md).
